To develop a Face Recognition Attendance system, several libraries are commonly required, primarily for facial detection, recognition, and database management. Below is a list of essential Python libraries:

1. Core Libraries
OpenCV: For image and video processing (capture and detection of faces).
pip install opencv-python

dlib: Used for face detection and facial landmark identification (required for face recognition).
pip install dlib

face_recognition: Simplifies face recognition tasks (built on dlib).
pip install face_recognition

numpy: Supports numerical operations and array manipulations (used with image data).
pip install numpy

2. Data Handling & Storage
pandas: For managing attendance data in tabular format (CSV, Excel, etc.).
pip install pandas

After all that you need to create Folder and give name as dataset and save it into Project folder  where your .Py file is present.
it is need for store your capture images to store in single folder and when user want to track data from prev then it match data 
for checking candidate is already present.
