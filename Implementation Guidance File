To develop a Face Recognition Attendance system, several libraries are commonly required, primarily for facial detection, recognition, and database management. Below is a list of essential Python libraries:

1. Core Libraries
OpenCV: For image and video processing (capture and detection of faces).
pip install opencv-python

dlib: Used for face detection and facial landmark identification (required for face recognition).
pip install dlib

face_recognition: Simplifies face recognition tasks (built on dlib).
pip install face_recognition

numpy: Supports numerical operations and array manipulations (used with image data).
pip install numpy

2. Data Handling & Storage
pandas: For managing attendance data in tabular format (CSV, Excel, etc.).
pip install pandas
